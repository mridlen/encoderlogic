Commodore 64 jQuery Terminal Demo
=======
# encoderlogic
A Soundcloud API interface built using JQuery Terminal, modified from the Commodore 64 demo https://github.com/jcubic/commodore64


Disclaimer: this is a very rough demo, and I do not provide any level of support, nor will I claim any responsibility if
the script breaks something and causes catastrophic damage to your system or to your Soundcloud account.

This is primarily created to promote my soundcloud website, but it may be useful for others as well.

All of the interface content is stored in the index.php, but the framework is under the terminal directory (JQuery Terminal).

If you are using this, you will need to supply your own Soundcloud API client key and website url or this will not work.

You will also need to find the references to your userid and replace that with your own user id.
